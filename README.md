An attempt to provide a codelab for Webrtc in Android - Similar to codelab for web at https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web/

## Setup Instructions

The test setup contains of three components:

1. Signaling server
2. WebRTC Android App
3. WebRTC example web site

Important: The IP address of the signaling server is hardcoded to `192.168.178.207` and need to be changed in files `SignallingClient.java` and `main.js`.

### Build Android App Client

- "Open an existing Android Studio project"
- Select the `Step-3` folder
- On "Unable to get Gradle wrapper properties from:" click "Ok" to recreate gradle files
- Ignore/Cancel all git related questions
- Agree to update Gradle
- Now a warning appears, agree to "Remove Build Tools version and sync project"
- Select "Files" "Sync Project with Gradle Files"
- Building and installing the App should work at this point

### Start Signaling Server

The signaling server works uses npm and nodejs:

```
cd signalling
npm install
node index.js
```

The last command start the signalling server.

### Start Web Client

```
cd signalling
python3 -m http.server
```

Now open `http://localhost:8000` in the browser.
You can use a different web server as the python buildin, of course.

## How to enable HTTPS

Change http to https in `signalling/index.js`, `signalling/js/main.js` and `Step-3/app/src/main/java/xyz/vivekc/webrtccodelab/SignallingClient.java`.

Then create files `key.pem` and `cert.pem` (e.g. with openssl) and uncomment the key options in `signalling/index.js`.

Command to create `key.pem` and `cert.pem`:
```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
```
